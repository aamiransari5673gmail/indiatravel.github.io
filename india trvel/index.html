            <h3>adventure trail</h3>
            <p>Adventure travel is to go over and beyond the famous regular place, seeking out unknown adventures. The travel destination might be as near as a couple of km from your house, or it may be hundreds of kilometers from an exotic place in India.

Perhaps it's to do with the fast-paced and stressful lives we're leading, that adventure travel has come to be one of the fasting growing segments of the travel market. A growing number of travelers have been abandoning the typical beach hotels, and are actively searching for new adventures in their journeys. These excursions often bring significant private discovery, creation of new skills and comprehension, and cross-cultural experiences.
